You know what? I don't believe in anything like competition. In fact, competition, according to me, are catalysts. In this podcast, I'll explain to you exactly what I mean. Competition is for losers. Like people who are insecure, they look at others as competitors. They go and study them and they look at ways on how they can out beat them, out rank them and they are playing this whole market share game because they are living in a world of insecurity. But the way that I look at it is by analysing some of the top companies like Apple, Steve Jobs. Even though he was competing head on with Microsoft and was at it with Bill Gates and stuff like that. If you look at his work ethic and the way that he approached Apple and the way Apple has grown over the years to become one of the cash rich companies today in the world is he always approached it with a vision of following his intuition and gut and keeping customer experience on the front and letting his customers lead the way rather than his competitors lead the way. This has been a big inspiration for me from the beginning. Even if I know that there are hundreds of people doing similar things I actually don't go and look at what they are doing and stuff like that because for me, my energy is super duper focused on getting feedback from my own customers. And based on my customers needs, I innovate new ways to make it happen. Which is what has brought it to a point where many of my so called competitors are studying what I am doing and they are replicating similar models and doing it for themselves and I am very happy about it. And I want the industry to grow as a whole and not look at this as a competitive game. I look at every competitor of mine as a catalyst. For example, somebody might have gone to their course and they might have gone to my course and they go to somebody else's course and all of that knowledge adds up. So overall, we are actually contributing to the growth of the entire industry. If you are looking at the digital coaching industry, the same happens in every other industry. If you look at the movie industry, you need to have somebody who is an apparent competition to really grow the industry. Even if you are looking at an industry like sport for example, unless there is competition, there is no game. Imagine there is an India-Pakistan cricket match and Pakistan, they decide not to play the game. There is no fun over there. Only when there is opposition, there is fun. And opposition in a way which is very very healthy. So the way that I look at this entire game of digital coaching, many people doing similar things is that if you are relentlessly focused with a high level of work ethic to do whatever it takes to help your people and your students get results, what were they looking out for in terms of their goals, wants and aspirations, you will be far ahead from your so-called competitors. Because if you are focusing your energy on looking at what other competitors are doing, you are actually neglecting the main thing which is what your customers really need. You will get ideas from various different places. Tactics can evolve, but when you truly tap into the power of your own mind and your own creative power to generate new ways and ideas and solutions, you will start to become a path maker and a path breaker so that others can follow you. That's what is my intent of this podcast, is to inspire you to create a path that others will follow in your own topic and your own niche. That's how I look at competition.
